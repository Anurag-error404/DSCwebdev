        <h2>Here's My quick introduction</h2>Hi, I am <em>Anurag Verma</em>, Fresher at COE Branch, NSUT;
        And I am from Delhi. This is the first ever website created by me and i hope you 
        like it. I was also intrested in Machine learning and Android Development , but 
        because of time constraint. I opted for this only and put in my honest efforts to create 
        this website . It was quite a new learning experience for me as it introduced e the world of 
        web Development. And I am looking forward to explore it more :-) .
